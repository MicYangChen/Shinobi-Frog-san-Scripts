# Shinobi-Frog-san-Scripts
The scripts for the game "Shinobi Frog-san" by SerpentSea available on https://serpentsea.itch.io/

Disclaimer: The game "Shinobi Frog-san" is my first ever real game I made. It is a 2D platformer game made in Unity Engine.

The game uses assets from Unity Asset Store such as Pixel frog and Cainos.
The music in the game is entirely made by the developer, Michael Chen AKA SerpentSea.

This GitHub repository contains c# scrips for the game.
