# Shinobi-Frog-san-Scripts
The scripts for the game "Shinobi Frog-san" by Michael Chen. The game is available on https://micyangchen.itch.io/shinobi-frog-san

Disclaimer: The game "Shinobi Frog-san" is the first (excluding school projects) game I ever made. It is a 2D platformer game made in Unity Engine. This game is a project that I used to get familiar with how Unity Engine works and how I should approach towards my future games.

The game uses assets from Unity Asset Store such as Pixel frog and Cainos.
The music in the game is entirely made by the developer, Michael Chen.

This GitHub repository contains c# scrips for the game.
